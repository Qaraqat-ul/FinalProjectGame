#  FinalProjectGame: **TriSwitch**

A logic-driven 2D platformer built on teamwork and smart switching.

---

##  About the Project

**TriSwitch** is a student-developed 2D puzzle platformer where you control **three unique characters** — **Miss J**, **Miss K**, and **Mister B**.  
Each of them has special skills, and only by combining these abilities can you solve puzzles and complete levels.

What makes this project stand out:
-  It’s not just about reflexes — it’s about **thinking**.
-  In harder levels, you **don’t switch** characters. Instead, they **move together** like a synchronized squad.
-  Completing a level with all three — especially in sync — is considered a **record**, and it unlocks **rewards**.

##  Characters

### Miss J — _The Agile_
- Wall-jumps with ease
- Can double-jump and squeeze into tight spaces
- Super mobile and fast

### Miss K — _The Magnetic_
- Controls magnetic fields
- Pulls and pushes metal objects
- Can build bridges and open new paths

###  Mister B — _The Brain_
- Interfaces with terminals, switches, and puzzles
- Solves logical sequences
- A must-have for tech-based interactions

---

##  Levels Overview

###  **Level 1 — Tutorial**
- All three characters are used
- Learn how to switch and combine powers

###  **Level 2 — Medium**
- You pick **two** characters
- Movement is **synchronized** (both act together)
- Requires strategic planning

###  **Level 3 — Hard**
- Can be completed solo
- But finishing with **all three** (in sync!) sets a **record**
- Special **bonuses** are unlocked for mastery

---

##  Core Rules

- Free switching is only available in **Level 1**
- In Level 2 and 3, movement is **group-based** — all selected characters move together
- Each character accesses **unique areas**
- Completing the final level with all three = **reward** + **record**

##  Why We're Building This

We’re developing TriSwitch as a team to:

- Practice real collaboration using **Git**, **branches**, and **pull requests**
- Structure code smartly using **LibGDX**
- Break responsibilities across clear folders:
    - `characters` – logic for each hero
    - `levels` – game stages and layouts
    - `logic` – interactions, switches, gates
    - `screens` – menu, game over, etc.
    - `utils` – assets, constants, input

We're managing the project in **Trello**, using a **To-Do / Doing / Done** board for progress, and splitting tasks across Git branches for smooth teamwork.

 **Final Goal**  
Create a small but polished puzzle platformer that rewards smart thinking, teamwork, and creative planning — both for players and developers.
