About the Project
TriSwitch is our student project — a 2D puzzle platformer where the player controls three different characters: Miss J, Miss K, and Mister B.
Each character has their own abilities, and the levels are designed in a way that makes the player combine their skills.
It’s not just about jumping — it’s about thinking.

In easy levels, the player can freely switch between characters. But as the game gets harder, things change: in some levels, all three characters move together like one synchronized team. If you complete such a level with all of them — that’s a real achievement, a record.

Characters
Miss J — agile and jumpy. She can wall-jump, double jump, and fit through tight spaces. Very mobile.

Miss K — controls magnetic fields. She can attract or push metal objects to create bridges, paths, or tools.

Mister B — the brains of the team. He works with terminals, buttons, and solves logical puzzles.
Without him, nothing really works.

Levels
We’re building three levels, each with its own logic and difficulty:

Tutorial (Level 1) — players learn how to switch between characters and use their powers. Simple and clear.

Medium level (Level 2) — switching is disabled. The player picks two characters and controls them at the same time — one move means both move. That’s when real strategy begins.

Hard level (Level 3) — can be completed by just one character, but finishing it with all three (synchronously!) is considered a record. The game rewards those players.

Core Rules
Switching between characters is only allowed in the first level.

In level 2 and 3, characters move together as a group — all actions are synchronized.

Each character has unique zones they can access, so you’ll need to use their abilities smartly.

Completing the hardest level with all three characters unlocks a reward and a record.

Why We’re Doing This
We’re working on this project together to practice teamwork, architecture, and just try using LibGDX in a real game.
The code is organized into folders: characters, levels, logic, screens, and utils.
We plan to use Trello for task tracking and split our work into Git branches for easier collaboration.
